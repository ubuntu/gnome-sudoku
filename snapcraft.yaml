summary: Test your logic skills in this number grid puzzle
description: |
  Play the popular Japanese logic game. GNOME Sudoku is a must-install for
  Sudoku lovers, with a simple, unobtrusive interface that makes playing
  Sudoku fun for players of any skill level.

  Each game is assigned a difficulty similar to those given by newspapers
  and websites, so your game will be as easy or as difficult as you want it
  to be.

  If you like to play on paper, you can print games out. You can choose how
  many games you want to print per page and what difficulty of games you
  want to print: as a result, GNOME Sudoku can act a renewable Sudoku book
  for you.
